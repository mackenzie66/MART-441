                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> My name is MacKenzie Dean and I am from Great Falls Montana.</p>
                <p> I have been a griz fan my whole life and am the third generatioon to attend this school.</p>
                <p> My interest in art first began when I was five.</p>
                <p>Most of my focus has been in Graphic Design but I have other skills in Media arts</p>

                <div>
                    <div class="menu-item">Most of my skills revolve around graphic design. I love to draw and create art. I am currently
                        a media arts major on a digital technology track. In addition I am minoring in business. Being in in this program has allowed 
                        me to aquire new skills, primarily in Adobe programs. I have a little knowledge about coding and web design but am a bit rusty.
                    </div>
                    <div class="menu-item">With my degree in particular I feel like experience is key. In the past I used to design T-shirts
                        logos for my highschool. I have also helped some local business here in Missoula design t-shirts and help with their poster 
                        designs. Most of my passion and inspiration comes from how I was raised. My dad is an artist and almost everyone in my famioly is involved 
                        or creates art of their own. By the end of this semester I plan on graduate with honors and a BFA.

                            <h1>Perspective</h1>
                            <p>Over all I am a very happy positive person. What I fear most is the progression of technology. This is the one thing
                                that constantly rattles around in my brain is in my job in media arts will become obsolet. I guess you could say This
                                is why I love art. Art is extremly personal and unique. This is one area where I feel like it hard to replicate "human touch".
